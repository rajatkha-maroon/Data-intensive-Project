No. of racks - 48
No. of midplanes within a rack - 2
No. of node boards within a midplane - 16
No. of nodes in a node board - 32
No. of cores in a node - 16

Total nodes: 48*2*16*32 = 49152
Total cores: 49152*16 = 786432

The nodes are laid across within 5 dimensions in a midplane of size 4x4x4x4x2, thus giving a total of 512 nodes in a midplane.
Memory (DDR3) is equally distributed across nodes.
Memory per node - 768TB/49152 = 16GB

1. Machine name: MIR-x1x2x3x4x5-y1y2y3y4y5-n
Each xi and yi are the node indices (start and end) in each dimension.

2. Resources are allocated in the granularity of a midplane contiguously. Basically, a job will be allocated at least 512 nodes.

Examples:
1. MIR-40800-73BF1-2048
2048 nodes implies 4 midplanes. Here, 4x4x4x16x2 equals 2048.
Largest no. of nodes in a dimension - 16, hence, it proves a total of 4 miplanes were allocated.

2. MIR-48C00-7BF71-1-1024
1024 nodes implies 2 midplanes.
Higest no. of nodes in a dimension - 8 -> 2 midplanes!

'1' in the 4th columns of this name corresponds to the fact that only 1 rack is used since 1 rack can accomodate 2 midplanes.
