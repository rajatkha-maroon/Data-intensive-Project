# Debugging the Build Process

To debug the build process ensure the docker image is pulled and start in interactive session as follows:

	DOCKER_IMAGE=quay.io/pypa/manylinux1_x86_64
	PLAT=manylinux1_x86_64

	docker pull $DOCKER_IMAGE
	docker run -e PLAT=$PLAT -v `pwd`/../:/io -v `pwd`/../../..:/darshan -it $DOCKER_IMAGE /bin/bash


Or to jump into a running docker container:

	docker exec -it <NAME> bash
